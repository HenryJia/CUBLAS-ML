# CUBLAS-ML

This is a library for ML (currently just NNs) written in CUBLAS and CUDA.

Currently it can only do function approximation problems but it is in development. I am currently trying to "upgrade" the algorithm to learn from simple batch gradient descent to a hessian method which would be much faster.

I am just a 16 year old kid so if you feel that my work deserves it, feel free to send donations to my parents PayPal account:

Any donations would be greatly welcomed and would realyl help in encouraging me to work on this project and projects like this :)
